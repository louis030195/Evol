Thanks to this video you will learn how to add to Unity unlit and raw, colourless scene some light with lustrous and vibrant colours like those on the video https://youtu.be/fVYjK8T2DKk and screens. This can be done easily and effortlessly thanks to the Lightning box 2 tool.

Post processing and lightning in this presentation are from the Lightning Box 2 +HD asset. This asset is also not included in the set due to property rights. I encourage to download and experiment on light and colours.
