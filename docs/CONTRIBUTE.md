## Unity development
### Naming convention
Use JetBrains Rider, it will fix your naming convention automatically, except in Evol we use Pascal casing for public member used in editor (Unity seems to use Camel casing but I started like that so let's keep it this way), for example:
```csharp
// Correct
public int MyInt;
// Wrong
public int myInt;
```
